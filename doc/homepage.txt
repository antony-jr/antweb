Homepage Technology Notes
-------------------------

Homepage is weird on Antweb. Uses the template engine so that it is modifiable. 
    See the Curate page, "Edit Home Page for": Antweb Home Page

Attempted to transfer to a simple page but the background image not working.
    Struts ready with index2.do. index2.jsp and index2-body.jsp created from the templates.
  
/data/antweb/index.jsp does this:
    <% request.getRequestDispatcher("/index.do").forward(request, response); %>
     
index.do returns /web/homepage/index.jsp
    which includes /web/homepage/index-body.jsp

So to modify the homepage, edit /data/antweb/web/homepage/index-body.jsp
    on the live server!

Create backup of the file as you are modifying a live file.

This will not be in effect in the development environment until:
    scp mjohnson@antweb-prod:/data/antweb/web/homepage/index-body.jsp /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/antweb/web/homepage/.
