mod_jk

    /etc/apache2   here is httpd.conf (on dev [mac])

    ComputerName: MacProâ€™s MacBookPro4,1
    Personal website in home folder, Sites folder here: http://10.5.30.175/~macpro/
    Computer's website: http://10.5.30.175/
    Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2
    mod_jk-1.2.25-httpd-2.2.4.so is for Apache 2.2.x and works with Apache 2.2.4 and later.
    Instructions: http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/webserver_howto/apache.html
    download mod_jk here: http://apache.cyberuse.com//tomcat/tomcat-connectors/jk/binaries/macosx/jk-1.2.25/x86/
    There is no /usr/lib/apache     
    ServerRoot /usr
    Listen 80
    Put downloaded mod_jk...so here: /usr/libexec/apache2/mod_jk-1.2.25-httpd-2.2.4.so
    Added to httpd.conf: LoadModule jk_module libexec/apache2/mod_jk-1.2.25-httpd-2.2.4.so
    Turn on Web Sharing in System Preferences
    
    at the end of your httpd.conf
    Include $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/jk/mod_jk.conf-auto

    Added to server.xml Engine section...    
    <Engine ...>
    ...
    <Listener className="org.apache.jk.config.ApacheConfig" modJk="/usr/libexec/apache2/mod_jk-1.2.25-httpd-2.2.4.so " />

    After Tomcat restart, mod_jk.conf should be generated.  An empty jk directory and auto/mod_jk.conf created.
    Seems to work.

$ sudo make install
    
Which reported:

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/libexec/apache2

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Now, apache can return only images in the root directory.  503 returned for all nested content
  If apache is started before tomcat, tomcat apps won't work.
  if apache is started afterwards, or not started, tomcat apps work.

 On Mac2
  Uncomment the loadmodule php5 line in httpd.conf
  copy php.ini.default to php.ini.  Removing the error_reporting Notice parameter
  
  Created imageUploadGuts.html.  Hardcode the group to be 1.
   This allows us to test the php in Apache without Tomcat running at the same time (avoid mod_jk).
   
  Error mysql_connect().  Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lmysql/mysql.sock"
  Run mysql.  /s  to find out proper socket.  It is /tmp/mysql.sock.
  Modify /etc/php.ini to use /tmp/mysql.sock as mysql.default.socket

  Can now access as 10.5.30.140/imageUpload/imageUploadGuts.html
  
  Had to chmod 777 the privs on the /Library/Webserver/Documents/imageUpload directory and contents

 On antweb2:
  Copied libphp5.so into /usr/local/apache2/modules/  (from antweb.org:/etc/httpd/modules/)
  Add 
  
  Modified /etc/init.d/httpd to point (in two places) to /usr/local/apache2/bin instead of /usr/sbin/

  Modified /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf to support php - copied from original antweb conf file
    Each case was documented with a Mark note.

* Thau compiled Apache from source to be able to configure with mod_jk on CentOs.

"The problem with compiling from source is that you are then on the hook to handle any security updates 
that are required, without any leadtime the distribution vendors might have. This is particularly 
critical for things that are accessed remotely, like (for example) Apache or PHP. 
In other words, you've just defeated the security benefits of CentOS (or any other distro). Not a good idea. "

"Why would you pick CentOS if you are going to compile your own apps? 
It complete breaks the stability and security that is the core of RHEL/CentOS."


  In order to get libphp5.so 
  rpm -ql php 

  Added the following to /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:
    LoadModule php5_module	      /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/libphp5.so

Startup Configuration

added to /etc/rc.local..

/etc/init.d/priv_tomcat start

May 19 4:05 downtime.
  Following the 4:05 am reboot, apache failed to come up and support tomcat.

  The startup command fails:  sudo /etc/init.d/httpd start

Somewhere there's a directory like

cd to that directory
./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs
make
make install
  
restart httpd and keep your fingers crossed.  Let me know if you can't
find the directory.
