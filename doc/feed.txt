This documentation organizes our understanding of Antweb feeds.

To summarize: Antweb data is available to other organizations in various ways.

Feeds
  EOL - Discontinued Feb 2021
  TAPIR / GBIF
  Plazi
  BOLD
  
  
  
EOL - Encyclopedia of Life - Discontinued Feb 2021. Quarterly exports agreement ended in 2016.
    We make available to EOL an XML feed.  As of Nov 2011, the /getEOL.do action will cause
an xml file to be generated on the server, and will return a hyperlink to this file: /eol/eol.xml.
	The file can be quite large (33MB).  It will display nicely in Firefox.  If there is a parse error,
perhaps due to some unescaped data, then Chrome will accurately report where the error is in the file.
    We agree with EOL to generate the file quarterly.  
    
Plazi
    Plazi SPM published and put on Antweb.  Different species identifiers.  We use current valid names. 
They use literature names (old).   They need to create a current_valid_name.  Or AntCat could query.
    Wait on this for Plazi and AntCat to come along
    

TAPIR, GBIF, TDWG, ...   
  TAPIR - XML schema that allows us to  - field structure mapping.
    There is a new format to replace TAPIR
    Stan wants to set up a server
    http://antweb.org/tapirlink/www/tapir.php
    We want to publish specimen data in GBIF format
  TDWG - Meeting place for people working on biodiversity databases.  Thau and Stan go.
     DarwinCore was the predecessor of TAPIR
     UN distributes GBIF (Global Bio Informatis Facilitator) is the protocal.
