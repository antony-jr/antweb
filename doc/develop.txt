This document is designed to contain the necessary information for an engineer to be able to support development of Antweb.  This includeds checking out, compiling and deploying the software.



Checkout
--------
cvs -d :ext:mjohnson@antweb.org:/data/cvsroot co -d antweb antweb  
  // 1st antweb is directory to checkout into.
  // 2nd antweb is the cvs repository
  // Checkout out using your server login.  You must be in the antweb user group (luke and thau are).
  // Guess the password.
  // You may check out the soure tree to wherever you like.

  //or, if you are on the production machine, simply:

cvs -d /data/cvsroot co -d antweb antweb

  
Config
------
     This is a new process that will configure an Antweb installation to it's environment.  It will
instantiate the appropriate supporting files by creating softlinks to the files in the etc directory.
Head the appropriate /etc/config* file to see how it is invoked.  Create your own build.properties
file and config.sh file to suit your environment, and then invoke, for instance, as such:

sh etc/configMark.sh
  
      On production (antweb.org) this will be:
     
sh etc/configAntweb.sh

      And on stage (currently 10.2.22.112 - the old antweb server, logins unchanged) this will be:
      
sh etc/configStage.sh

  
Compile and Deploy
------------------
ant deploy
  // This step will compile all files into the antweb/build directory, and deploy that directory to
  // the tomcat app server webapps dir (or /data/antweb in the case of production).


On Production and Staging Servers
---------------------------------
It is intended that the above steps should be the same on the production servers as on development machines.
Here are some links to useful resources on the servers... (see antweb/bin/links.sh):

antweb.log -> tomcat/logs/antweb.log
appCheck.log -> /var/log/tomcat/appCheck.log
access_log -> /usr/local/apache/logs/access_log
error_log -> /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log
imageUpload -> /var/www/html/imageUpload/
tomcat -> /usr/local/tomcat
workingdir -> /home/antweb/workingdir


CVS Commit
----------
It is assumed that whatever code is in CVS at any given time is valid to deploy to production.  At
deployment time, or at commit time, send release notes and file mods to the release engineer (currently
Mark).
