ProjectData is a process to work around an unfortunate design decision of Thau's.  He put everything
into the web deployment directory - The antweb application, images (100s of GB), generated files,
and user created files.  In order to have an instance of the application running, it needs to have
these files (for instance the home page, project pages, ancillary pages, ProjectResources.properties,
etc...)  Using a script on the server (antweb/bin/copyProjectData.php) we are able to create a 
copy of the relevant data minus the images.  Once it is transfered, following this procedure will
update a dev or staging environment to function properly.

from tomcat/webapps/antweb directory...  For example:
  cp -r /Users/mark/dev/calacademy/bak/projectData/projectData2011-02-09\=15\:59/* .
  rm WEB-INF/classes/ApplicationResources.properties

From the antweb codebase root:
  sh etc/configMark.sh  
  ant deploy
  
Restart server from the tomcat bin dir
  sudo ps ax | grep java
  sudo kill -9 [pid]
  sudo sh startup.sh
