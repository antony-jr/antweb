Mark:
Also, Brian wonders, "if I simply need to save the files as html and
then you can run the code."  I got the impression for our exchanges
that the process is a bit more extensive and worth going over.

Dave, Jul 7 (12 days ago):
Yeah, it's slightly more complicated but not too much more.  It's basically

1. convert all to html
2.  there are 2 files that capture genus/subfamily info that need to
be combined (cat a b > c)
3.  then you copy the files over to a special directory
4.  then you can run the code
5.  you get an excel file that's just an authority file that brian can look at
6.  when he's happy with it, you upload the authority file to world ants

I'll need to poke around cvs to get the right directory for #3 and the
right path for #4

The annoying and most time consuming thing is the html conversion.

--------------------------

Dave: Ok, here it is.
  
If you look under browse, in Global, you'll see there's something called "Bolton's Catalog" or some such. See that?
8:15 PM 
me: Yes, the Bolton World Catalog?
 
Dave: Yes
  
Ok, that's a "project" for all the "valid" ant species according to Bolton's World Catalog.
  
Now, there are a ton of ants that are in antweb but are not valid according to bolton.
8:16 PM 
They're all like Camponotus mg02, Camponotus undet, Aphaenogaster blf3, and such
  
We had a plan for another entry in the "global" section under browse called something like "All ants" or something... I can't remember the wording. Luke would know
8:17 PM 
Anyway, your task, should you choose to accept it, is to add that "All ants" to the global section of browse.
8:18 PM 
It's mostly stubbed in throughout the code.

---------------------------

The first step is converting all the
documents to HTML using word.  That's probably the most time consuming
step.  I have a macro for it, but I can't get to it right now

' Save all as text - save all open documents as text files
Sub SaveAllAsHTML()
   Dim a$
   For Each adoc In Documents
       a$ = adoc.Name + ".html"
       adoc.SaveAs FileName:=a$, FileFormat:= _
       wdFormatHTML, AddToRecentFiles:=False
       adoc.Close
   Next adoc
End Sub

Open all the documents - that itself takes a long time - then run this
macro.  It'll convert all open documents to HTML.

--------------------

Ok, here are the steps for Bolton.  First, one big caveat. I've always
run this on my local machine, a mac.  So, you could either get
everything running on your loaner mac, or you could try doing it on
your pc and see what happens, or you could try running in on the linux
box and see what happens.  I'm not sure it runs on the linux box -
whether or not all the code has been checked in.  And, I'm not sure
what character encoding issues you'll run into.....  I'm guessing that
after you've done the conversion to HTML, everything should run ok on
your windows box...

0.  back up extant.xls and extinct.xls in docroot/worldAuthorityFiles
- if anything goes wrong, you can revert to these
1.  export all the bolton files to HTML
2.  cat NGC-GEN.A-L.docx.html  NGC-GEN.M-Z.docx.html > subfamily_genus.txt
3. copy all the files starting with numbers, and the NGC-Sp* files and
the subfamily_genus.txt file to:
   docroot/worldAuthorityFiles (maybe make a backup of what's there
now), and synopsis.txt
4.  go to docroot/world_authority_admin.jsp   (must be logged in)
5.  use the pulldown to upload one species file (it's the last option
in the pulldown) - you can pick any of the html files you just made -
one of the ones you copied over.
6.  if all goes well, this will generate two files in
doctroot/worldAuthorityFiles - extant.xls and extinct.xls - you can
download then with the links on docroot/world_authority_admin.jsp
7.  these are authority files, look them over to see if they're ok.
extant.xls is the bolton catalog and extinct.xls is for the extinct
ants project.

That should do it.  Let me know how it goes.

---------

Me:
   A few question about the Bolton stuff.  You mention synopsis.txt
which I have not found anywhere.  What is this and where?
   As for the process, from your doc it seems that I would only run a
single file through in order to get the files extant.xls and
extinct.xls.  If those are good we can assume that all are?  And then
I will send the whole batch to Brian?

According to the docs on world_authority_admin.jsp: This latter file,
once it's uploaded will be renamed subfamily_genus.txt.
But, I created that file by concatenating NGC-GEN.A-L.html and
NGC-GEN.M-Z.html ... ?

    I am stuck on the synopsis.txt.  Here is where I would expect it:

[mark@antweb antweb]$ cd /data/antweb/worldAuthorityFiles/

Dave:
To tell you the truth, I'm confused about synopsis.txt.  I'm pretty
sure it's generated by the code - take a look at the
WorldAuthorityGenerator.java code to see if it is.  If it's not, I'll
have to hunt around.

The code there in WorldAuthorityGenerator looks at all the files in
the directory and processes them all, so really the business of
choosing a file to upload is silly - I originally thought I'd be
getting a file at a time, rather than the whole dump every time.  So
basically, uploading a file just triggers the generation of the files.

--------

Ok, I poked around the code a bit.  synopsis.txt is a concatenation of
the HTML generated from all the Bolton files that start with numbers
except the one about extinct ants. I'm attaching a copy of that file
here.  So, take back what I said about copying all the number starting
files over to docroot/worldAuthorityFiles - don't copy those over -
convert them to html and concat them into a file called synopsis.txt.

Hmm... looking at my code, I don't think the file gets renamed, so
when you concatenate those two files, name the result
subfamily_genus.txt

Ok.... I think that should set you up.  Good luck!  Sorry this is so
crack-addled - it's probably the lamest part of the whole system.


------

So it looks like this.

1) Save each file from docx to html from MS Word

2) Concat the NGC-GEN files...

cat NGC-GEN.A-L.html > subfamily_genus.txt
cat NGC-GEN.M-Z.html >> subfamily_genus.txt

3) Concat all of the files beginning with numbers, except for the extinct ones, into synopsis.txt
cat 01.\ FORMICIDAE.html > synopsis.txt
cat 02.\ DOLICHODEROMORPHS.html >> synopsis.txt
cat 03.\ FORMICOMORPHS.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 04.\ MYRMECIOMORPHS.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 05.\ DORYLOMORPHS.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 06.\ ECTAHETEROMORPHS.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 07.\ MYRMICOMORPHS\ 1.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 08.\ MYRMICOMORPHS\ 2.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 09.\ PONEROIDS.html  >> synopsis.txt
cat 10.\ LEPTANILL\ \&\ MARTIAL.html  >> synopsis.txt

4) Back up all server files in /data/antweb/worldAuthorityFiles/

5) Copy all files (synopsis.txt, subfamily_genus.txt and NGC-SP* files) to directory
/docroot/worldAuthorityFiles/

6) After login.jsp go to world_authority_admin.jsp.  Enter any file (I used NGC-Spa-an.html) and submit.
Send /data/antweb/worldAuthorityFiles/extant.xls to Brian so that he may rename extant.txt and upload
as an authority file.
