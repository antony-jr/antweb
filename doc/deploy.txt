Commands on the client and server to effect a deployment.

--- On the Client
ant clean

  # Clean then deploy to be sure that any method signature changes need to be tested via compilation.

sudo killall java -9
sh startup.sh
  # From /usr/local/tomcat/bin to start and stop the server.

tail -f /usr/local/tomcat/logs/antweb.log
  # Log file found here:

cvs commit -a -m "8.42"
  # A line like this commits the changes to git locally.

git push
  # Push the changes to the global repository

--- On the server

cd /antweb/deploy

sh bin/srcBackup.sh 8.41
  # From /antweb/deploy run with last version number in order to create a /antweb/bak/rel a file like antweb8.41.zip

git pull

sh etc/configProd.sh
  # This shouldn't be necessary except after install? In order to configure a build for a given platform.
  # To test, ls -al WEB-INF/classes/AntwebResources.properties
    # Should point to -> ../../etc/AppResProd.properties

ant clean

run database scripts

ant deploy

watch logs
  cd /home/mjohnson/links/
  tail -f antweb.log

sudo /etc/init.d/priv_tomcat start



---


In a working dir such as /home/mark/antweb/

cvs -d /data/cvsroot co -d antweb antweb
  // Would add :ext:mark@antweb.org: before the /data if on a remote machine
  
Verify Files:
  build.xml - property app.name should be appropriately defined (antweb or antweb_test)
  WEB-INF/classes/ApplicationResources.properties - all of the site.* properties should have
    appropriately defined paths and app name.

ant deploy

sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat5 restart  

test


Create softlinks in WEB-INF/classes/
ln -s ../../etc/AppResLiveAntwebTest.properties ApplicationResouces.properties
ln -s ../../etc/log4jAntwebTest.properties log4j.properties



On Development machines:
  If a fresh build, then certain files should be copied in or created through the 

Installation (working notes)
  Copy index_body.jsp from live site to web dir 
  WEB-INF/classes/ApplicationResources.properties
    ? really - change 8080 to ""
    site.url=http://localhost/antweb/
    Where does this file come from?  In /antweb/WEB-INF/classes/ApplicationResources.properties it has a site.inputfilename
  ProjectResources.properties not in CVS.  Dynamically generated.  Why?  no reason?  Not so much, it seems.
  Copied in to enable local browsing
	arizona.jsp, arizona-body.jsp
  Check build.xml's app.name and app.home.  Using test?  
  struts-config.xml contains the database url, pwds, etc...
  Copy web/statistics.jsp and web/recentImages_gen_inc.jsp from server to web directory
