Python Development Document.


Some scripts are run. This (rough) documentation gathers clues for the process.



To run one of the scripts:
  python3 imageCheck.py  
   
To install a missing module:
  pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy
  # Fails due to security. Use venv.
  
Instead, using venv:
  python3 -m venv env
  source ./env/bin/activate 
  python -m pip install flask_sqlalchemy

Inside the venv, this could work:
  pip3 install --upgrade pip

requirements.txt should be used as such:
  To create a requirements.txt from a configured environment:
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  To load that environment:
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
