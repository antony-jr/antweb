Antweb.org source -> Github


----

For security reasons (and because it is good practice), we are using a “deploy key” (worth looking up) for the server. This means that you can only move files from the repository to the deploy server, not the other way. This prevents an attacker from destroying the GitHub repo, should they compromise the antweb system.

----

To generate keys...

  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "mjohnson@calacademyorg"

Start the ssh-agent in the background.

  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Automatically load keys into the ssh-agent
  
  touch ~/.ssh/config   // Do this if the file doesn't already exist
  open ~/.ssh/config

Add private key to ssh-agent

  ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy the key into the keyboard buffer for pasting into 
  
  pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Finally paste into Github... 

  https://github.com/settings/keys

To set the name and email address globally

 git config --global --edit
  
Set user name
 
  git config user.name "Mark Johnson"
  
  Different from Github username: remarq    

--- Or, to enable git access from mark account via antweb's key, from /home/mark/
 cp home/antweb/.ssh/id_rsa to .ssh/
 sudo chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa
