* The new server architecture does seem to work as expected (stability issues, performance issues, upload reports are not returned, some http requests are doubled). 

* The docker environment changes file locations. (Some of this might just need more clear documentation. but also finding features that fail):     
    On the live server, working now but earlier today the "Specimen file reload" returned /usr/local/antweb/workingDir/specimen1.txt (No such file or directory)    
    Locally, I had to recreate the /mnt/antweb/web/log and log/specimen and log/worldants dirs. 
      The app used to do create directories if they were not present at install, but it can not do with the softlinks. /usr/local/antweb/web/upload    
    I have already done a lot of massaging of Antweb custom log files.

* Stage server. Still getting Service Unavailable for https://165.232.136.170/.

* Database loading procedure remains very tedious. The README.md has not worked for me and my own process is faulty. 

* Netdata warnings. Some days about 10/day. Not sure what to do with these. Some claim to be critical problems.
