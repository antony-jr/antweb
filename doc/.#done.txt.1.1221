Funny. met claire

populateMuseum is called from the scheduler but not individual one's after specimen upload.
How to ascertain which one to run? Like this:
  https://www.antweb.org/utilData.do?action=populateMuseum&code=ABS
...with the proper code after specimen upload. SpecimenUploadFull.java:185  
There is session.getAttribute("museumMap") and museumCalc in UploadAction.java:316.
We build the MuseumMap in AntwebUpload.saveSpecimen();
  Save it in uploadDetails. Session.
  MuseumMap seems to be set in session but is not found when needed. Where utilized?
UploadDetails.java:197 does not work. MuseumMap is null at report time. Hmmm.
There are two links to it in the admin section of the Overview page for a museum.
Also here: https://www.antweb.org/museum.do?museumCode=ABS&action=recalc 
Create catch all log file for the upload process.
Should be one consolidated, shared, logic. UtilData just a means of invocation.

To do:
  Status 
    Valid become Valid with fossil
    Valid extant will be default.
    Add Valid with fossil to the simple list.  

(1) Bioregions:  Looking at the Nearctic list, there are a few genera (Apterostigma, Procryptocerus, Sericomyrmex, Tatuidris) 
that should not be on the list and there are no specimens from the Nearctic. I think names get on the list if there is a 
specimen but names don't get off the list when the specimen is no longer there.  I think the bad names were added when there 
was at one time an erroneously tagged specimen with Nearctic in the bioregion field but have now been fixed.  
    So it seems we don't have a clear path for getting names on and off the bioregion lists.

I am looking closely at the geolocal records that have source=AntWeb specimen.  
For a given geolocal, source=AntWeb specimen should only be true if there is actually a specimen from that locality. 
However, it appears that  source=AntWeb specimen is true for every taxon if it has a specimen in AntWeb from anywhere in the world.  
And Example is  https://www.antweb.org/taxonomicPage.do?rank=species&adm1Name=Missouri&countryName=United%20States
to get an idea of what should be correct, just click on edit species list and see which names have a yellow icon.
This seems quite a serious issue and we should talk about how to go forward.  
1st item (fulva) on:
  https://www.antweb.org/taxonomicPage.do?rank=species&adm1Name=Missouri&countryName=United%20States

Species list
  Georgias.
  
  alter table taxon drop column default_specimen; 

  Names work. One step at a time.
    1. specimen. Update source. Override everything.
    2. Within usa adm1, blanks = curator. (except Georgia).
    3. Antwiki. Reflagged from old data. (Don't mess with madagascar).

  For adm1 in the USA, all of the blanks are source:curator if there are no specimen.  
  
  Would be good to flag as antwiki the geolocale_taxon records with null where the country is...
    select geolocale_id, taxon_name from geolocale_taxon where source is null and taxon_name in (select taxon_name from antwiki_valid_taxa);

  1. "Antweb Specimen" should trump all other "Sources" in geolocale_taxon, during specimenUpload.
    Test is in the California list, is Camponotus ca01 source="Antweb specimen" after PS Ward upload.
  2. Antwiki. Regional species list.
  3. Nulls outstanding.
          
  Save the Groups.upload_specimens field at the end of specimen upload.

Species list:  Thinking about California again, since Antwiki did not have data on California, 
  the only three options for the source would be specimen data or curator (new species list tool) 
  or oldspecies list.  But since we have specimens for most of them, 
  I am curious why "Specimen" is not showing up for those.  I think I found one without a specimen.

So we need a third category for status:  we can use Distribution status: "unknown" for these cases or even better "possibly introduced"

4)  The introduced species for a geolocal are not all indicated with the red "i"  I see that some are but not all.   
Also, I wonder if you could make a link to "introduced" on the overview page with the others summary stats. 
I know you love working on the summary stats so I am sure you will like this request: : )

eg: https://www.antweb.org/country.do?name=Comoros
Subfamilies: 7 
Genera: 40 
Species/Subspecies: 106 
  Endemic: 4 
*  Introduced: 
Imaged Specimens: 241 

ps 5)  If you have time, could you remind me about updating a species list like "Introduced"  
I wanted to add species to the list from Mauritius, Seychelles and Hawaii but it appears I can't add a second comparison list.  
I wonder if that is because it is not a geolocale so it doesn't work.  
  		
Integrity stuff to come to
  Subfamily counts for adm1 that are not valid and live.
  "Antweb Specimen" showing up on taxonomic pages. Species list pages.
  g api.
  Integrity checks.
  Non-valid names with no specimens. still on country lists. During specimen upload.
  

    Endemic - a subclass of native? (For Brian to figure).
      Means that it is only found there in the world. What ants are only found in the Comoros.
        Could be by and geolocale (bioregion, country, adm1). (Mountain).

There is an endemic flag in proj_taxon (came from Antwiki?)
  For instance, myrmicinaemonomorium latinode. These are not showing up on the Introduced Project.

Create documentation page for Distribution Status

Cerapachys should not be in Malagasy or Afrotropics or Neotropical or Nearctic, or Australia
But I think your plan was to use current distribution to fill the table and then I would unclick those regions that are not part of the native distribution or are in error.
otherwise, I am not sure how you would know Cerapachys is not in those regions.
does the species tool work again?

	  I have one question regarding how we report invalid adm1s. such as on the last CAS specimen upload:
	  2: Not valid Antweb Adm1 (total:3): Provence-AlpesCôte d'Azur, Semenawi K'eyih Bahri, Ulyanovsk
	  Since the last two are recognized and have a valid adm1, there is no reason to correct them.  The first one does need to be corrected since it is a typo.
	  I think we should only report unrecognized adm1s, that is adm1s with no known valid adm1.
	  I actually thought we were only reporting adm1s that were not linked to a valid adm1, so I am a bit confused why these two are being reported and not others.

From Brian (Nov 12, Alberta and BC)
For a very long time we had species lists for BC and Alberta but then they were lost (I guess when we moved to Georegions?).  I now have made all the Canada provinces live but the BC and Alberta species lists are gone
Alberta used to have about 93 species and BC around 58 species.  
I also made the species lists for India provinces live too.
Also on the overview page of BC:  https://www.antweb.org/adm1.do?name=British%20Columbia
I can't seem to get rid of the bad character ?  in the first sentence of the overview. it reads;
British Columbia is Canada?s westernmost province.
but should read
British Columbia is Canada's westernmost province.

  bioregion check in specimen upload.  Mexico must be in Nearctic or Neotropical, etc...
    for validation: the issue is that some countries: Indonesia, Mexico, China, a few in Africa, may have two bioregions possible.  So for some we would have to see if they had one or the other, but for most countries, there would be just one.  And if they didn't, AntWeb should replace their Bioregion with the correct one.  Currently, in Geolocal, you can only add one Bioregion to a country.  

  Bioregion and museum UI component and context for browse.
    (1) I want to see all the species in genus Stigmatomma  
    (2) I want to see all genera for subfamily Amblyoponinae
    (3) I want to see all species

  The Geolocale work.

Task List.
  Museum 
    Add a pie chart showing "Species per Bioregion. First pie chart for Museums.  
      this will highlight the differences of where the ants in a particular collection are from.  
    Specimen collection date distribution timeline.
  Fix numbers. Madagascar species/subspecies: 1300 but in taxa list 1296
  Remove specimens count from overview page, or attempt a proper calculation.  
    Seems like it would be good info?  For now it has been removed from display.
  Should calculate only for valids on overview page.  Change copy to specify.    
  Flesh out Calc/Crawl strategy.  Document.
    Image count crawl may need to be invoked after worldants upload.  
      Currently it is invoked ... ?  Manually, and...
    Museum regenerated after upload.  Automated and/or invoked by admin.  Curator option?
    Other Geolocales?
  Document mapping 1-1 geolocale to project.  Technical changes?
  fix the staff page issue.
  manageLogins.do
    LoginId on manageLogins page half-measure.
    remove the count, and give the header; login ID and Key and then list below like a table
  Display georegion needs more data, ordering?  GeolocaleMgrStats.do
    a list of the all countries, regions bioeregions adm1 with all these stats and you could 
    sort on them to rank by example the greatest number of subfamilies, endemic genera etc. 
  Make endemic (and endemic_percent) for all ranks and all overview types.
  Integration of Josh's UI.
  Adm1
    Make sure that a specimen like: https://www.antweb.org/specimen.do?name=casent0625424  
      which has adm1: Galapagos matches up without our (invalid) Galapagos listed as country.    
    Make Locality page hyperlink to country and adm1.
  Testing/Debugging of certain geolocales.  
    diacritics, spaces, and duplicated names.
    Currently it seems the counts are not working for duplicated names.  For list, see:
      https://antweb.org/util.do?action=curiousQuery&name=duplicatedGeolocaleNames
  
	Galapagos -> Galapagos Islands
	  GeolocaleDb.getGeolocales order by hack to get countries listed first so that Galapagos country is found instead of Galapagos adm1.
	Georgia US, Georgia Russia
	  georgiaants and georgiausaants
	Saint Vincent island and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
	  Email from Sun, Oct 18, 2015 at 11:55 AM
	  There are two projects: saintvincentandthegrenadinesants and st.vincentants
	  No.  St.Vincent is a invalid pointing to st.vincent and the grenadines.
	Mexico country and Mexico adm1.
	  mexicoants and mexicomexicoants

  Get rid of GeolocaleDB hack? We order the list by valids and invalids.  Confusing to UI.
    Document the funkiness of Galapogos.  During SpecimenUpload, searching for a adm1 will preferentially return
      a country.  The GeolocaleMgr.getRegions is ordered with valid countries first to enable this.  Sketchy.
    Ordering the species List Tool correctly?

  Link the UN offical list of countries and regions:  
    UN List: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm 
  Official list for admin 1 that could be used to check spelling
    source of ADM1 "statoids" http://www.statoids.com/wab.html

  Specimen validation
    In addition to country level bioregion testing, test on Adm1.  Perhaps just for exceptions like Hawaii.
    Test for mismatches between the recorded country and country of plotted lat. long, records that fall into the ocean, 
      and eventually outlier detection as suggested in attachment of email thread: Re: Release 6.4.6, Apr 30 2016.




Known Outstanding Issues
------------------------------------
No Canary Islands project or geolocale.
We need to move some coords and other properties from invalid geolocales to valid ones.
Map/image display largely untested on geolocale and project pages.
Add Galapagos invalid geolocale

Review 2015 Goals
----------  
Plazi and species list tool are on track.  That said I wont to go ahead with my plans for 2015. Here are the three goals for 2015 (in addition to are unfinished business from 2014).
(1) Create pages for each "Museum" to highlight the specimens and images on Antweb from the major Ant Collections around the world.  The goal is to give face to the museum and also encourage others to participate in Antweb.
(2) Create a page that provides graphs/pie charts on AntWeb contributions by Museum, person, type of content etc.
(3) Add a Donate button to Antweb, mimicking the way Wikipedia does it.

Homonyms
  Unresolved homonyms.  No ones gotten around to creating name.
  Senior homonym keeps it's name.  Valid according to Antcat and not mentioned as a homonym.  What I was calling master.
  Junior has to get a new name or it is invalid
    These can be unresolved.  Without a valid name.
    Find the unresolved junior homonyms.  Brian can write a paper to fix this.
