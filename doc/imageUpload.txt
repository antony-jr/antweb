Thau Documentation
------------------
     On the main curator page (what you get after logging in) there's a link to 
"upload images".  This is a somewhat tricky bit of coding involving the Yahoo YUI uploader described 
here: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/  I tried long and hard to get this thing working with 
Tomcat and failed.  So, it works with apache and php.  The code is all in /var/www/html/imageUpload/.  
On the jsp side, imageUpload.jsp has an iframe pointing to imageUploadGuts.jsp which contains the YUI 
code that inserts the flash dohickey and performs other YUI madness.  The upshot is that when someone 
uploads images, the PHP program getFiles.php makes sure that the files being uploaded meet a variety
of criterion - such as that some other group hasn't already uploaded an image of that name, and 
ensuring that we already have information about the specimen that the image represents.  Once 
getFiles.php whittles the upload down to files that are legitimate, the process.php does the work of 
processing the images.  It calls the perl program /home/antweb/workingdir/processImages which does 
all the ImageMagick and exif stuff, and it does the necessary database work too.  All in all, it 
seems a bit fragile, but it does let curators upload images.

Discovery
---------

The imageUpload function on /imageUpload.jsp is handled by /imageUpload/upload.php.  

php.ini is located here: /etc/php.ini

logging is turned on.  Log messages go to 

/etc/httpd/logs/error_log

/var/log/php-fpm/error.log

All references to php script are hardcoded in /imageUpload.jsp to refer to antweb.org.  Makes testing hard.


Problems
--------

Erin Problem #1
I encountered a few problems when uploading images to AntWeb.  When I tried to upload specimens 
labeled LACM ENT #######, instead of the standard CASENT, I got an error message saying they were 
incorrectly named and could not be uploaded.  Also, when I uploaded character images labeled 
CASENT #######_D_1, they replaced CASENT #######_D.  I went back and changed the originals to D_1 
and the character images to D_2, which corrected the problem,  but I think this should be fixed.


To force execute of the upload process to push images out of the imageUpload/toImages directory:
  sudo -u apache /home/antweb/workingdir/processImages.pl -a "Maïa Berman" -c "California Academy of Sciences, 2002-2012" -l "Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) Creative Commons License and GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)"

Ownership - 
  files should be owned by apache:apache as should the image directory it is in.
  -rw-r--r-- should be sufficient.  

sudo chown -R apache:apache csironc*

find . -user mjohnson | xargs sudo chown apache:apache




--- Image Upload ---
Sometimes some images get stuck in the /imageUpload/toUpload directory.  Perhaps they were already uploaded successfully?

Some characters are not allowed in image codes, but used to be.  In order to upload images
for these specimens, put the images in the toUpload directory and upload (or reupload) an
other image.  This will trigger the processImages script to generate web-sized jpgs.  
The exif data may be incorrect, in which case in may be modified as such:

[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_d_1_low.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_d_1_med.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_d_1_high.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_p_1_low.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_p_1_med.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_p_1_high.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_h_1_low.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_h_1_med.jpg"
[mjohnson@vAntWeb4 blf1753(46)-1]$ /usr/local/bin/exifedit -b -a artist="Cerise Chen" "blf1753(46)-1_h_1_high.jpg"

Probably should also update in database, but values do not seem to be used: 

select * from image where image_of_id = "blf1753(46)-1";
select * from artist;
update ...
