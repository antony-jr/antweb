"Shouldn't I inquire into what I want with who I want to inquire with?"  - Deb.
Should inquire into what is up for you.  We never inquired into our relationship, and so we learned nothing.
  What we learned is that we should not date each other.  That is the shallowest truth, perhaps not true if we could inquire.
Only one chance to be conscious while exiting relationship.
I feel jerked around and head fucked.  We never inquired into coldness.
I don't want to sleep with you.  I don't want to date you.  I don't want to talk to you.  I don't want to inquire with you.  When does it end?
  Never said an unkind word.  Never said what was true for her.
She stopped talking to me in an upbeat email.  And then in an upbeat email asked for a month off.  Sent to me the night after my performance.  Passive aggressive?
  Were these acts of hatred?  They sure had an annihilating effect.
Her coldness triggered by insecurity.
She can't inquire.  No judgement, but beyond capacity due to hatred.  Specifically, hatred is not ok to feel.  So a little bit is acted upon?
  I need to accept this.  For her, inquiry is identifying what is felt.  Not continuing until it transforms.
  No point me being upset by this.

How do I talk to Deb in a way that does not introduce my anger and resentment.
  I don't want to guilt her.
  Don't want to create a story that she did bad and owes me, because that is unpleasant and unskillful.

I am left impacted by her insensitivity.  To stop speaking to me after agreeing to inquire with me.
No inquiry!?

     I am stumped, it is upsetting, about how inquiry (which we love) into relationship could be so necessary and important for me, and (?) for you.  What is it for you?

Of course you can say no, but as a friend, a lover, a student of inquiry, I don't see how.  As trainees to be teachers, presence during this process seems a reasonable ambition.

     I feel I am getting clues from you that if I want to be a a friend or inquiry partner with you, I need to ignore our relationship.  Is that true?  That is not of interest to me and not why I entered into relationship with you.
     
     I wonder why it is not more appealing for you.  How it might be more appealing?  I wonder if it is possible for us to move the conversation forward.

     Would you be willing to inquire into these matters of import with me, perhaps after your return.

Mark
