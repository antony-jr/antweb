Hello Thau,
     Why does the taxon_country table have a primary key on the taxon_name?
     I am waiting to hear from you on these points...



  
For the purpose of raising quality, here are listed worrisome comments in the code:

UploadAction.java:1804
        // Somewhat goofy way to match biota field names to  
        // the database schema.  There's a better way to do this, but I don't have time now!
UploadAction.java:2526
        // this is a lame hack - if this is the Taxon table, go ahead and update it
     * Mark note.  Jan 3, 2011.  Yes and it did not work.  Resolved.
UploadAction.java:231
                    // do this 3 times because sometimes there are chains of synonyms - this is sort of a hack
                    // but should be ok...

These bits of code are interested:
        ancFile.setTitle(ancFile.getTitle());
        ancFile.setContents(ancFile.getContents());

Hold of on axing the zonageek stuff.  I'm pretty sure we don't need
it, but I need to double check.  The rest, yeah, don't need.

I'm pretty sure the whole TypeSearch thing is defunct and can be
removed.  See if you can find evidence to the contrary.

There are two design mistakes I made early in the project that may
make you sad:

1.  Maybe not a design mistake, but the way search works now is not
very easy to change and probably a bit confusing.  If you can get your
head around how that works, everything else is straightfoward.

2.  The biggest mistake I made is that taxon_name, which is the
primary key on the Taxon table upon which much of the code pivots, is
a string of the form "SubfamilyGenus species"  There are methods in
Utility.java for forming this name, but it turned out to be the source
of much annoyance for me.  For example, to find the specimens for a
species, you join on the taxon_name field in both tables and the
strings have to match.  The Taxon information comes from the authority
files, and the specimen information comes from the biota file, and if
the names in those sources don't match, the specimens won't show up on
the species page.

I did an analysis of how much faster the site would be if taxon_name
was an integer rather than a string, and I didn't get a huge boost, so
I left it that way.  However, it's been a constant source of
irritation for me.



--- File System: Jun 9th, 2010

The problem is there are several installation specific properties in
there - paths that vary depending on whether it's on your laptop or
deployed on antweb_test or in the main application.

Right.  These are all "dynamic" elements that may change if Brian
updates the home page, or someone updates arizona - for that reason
they don't belong in CVS.

> Why is there a build directory in the CVS tree?

No good reason.  It was an accident.

> Having ApplicationResource.properties in the source tree, and modified in a
> local deployment creates some risk in deploying to production, no?

No, because it's not in CVS.

> Why is the WEB-INF dir not in the web dir?

Hmmm..... it *is* when it gets deployed.... I feel like this was the
setup of one of the early example tomcat applications...

> Is it the case that you always deploy to antweb and luke always deploys to antweb_test?

No, I'll deploy to antweb_test to test things out.

NO BACKUP STRATEGY!  You would do a HUGE SERVICE to the site to set
one up.  I've just been doing regular database dumps and taring up the
code every once and a while.  The original TIF specimen images in
/data/antweb/images/ are all backed up somewhere, but the rest of the
images are not.

Yeah, that's probably prototype stuff - I'm not sure what shape it's in.

Automatic map generation was the last feature I added and there was a
bug that lead to that.  If you cvs update and then use the curator
tools to update the arizona home page, it should be fixed.

Perhaps I should "sudo ant deploy"
 Dave:  no....
check the group on that file
oops, you did it already, no?
 me:  yes/
 Dave:  I'm not convinced that directory is really valid ...
I think it's vestigal.

 Dave:  That documents directory can just be zapped.  It's old news.  Now it's covered by antweb.org/homepage/documentation.jsp and other stuff in antweb.org/homepage
On another front - you just deployed something that I 1/2 completed and you should probably do the other 1/2

 Dave:  Ok, here it is.
If you look under browse, in Global, you'll see there's something called "Bolton's Catalog" or some such.  See that?
 me:  Yes, the Bolton World Catalog?
 Dave:  Yes
Ok, that's a "project" for all the "valid" ant species according to Bolton's World Catalog.
Now, there are a ton of ants that are in antweb but are not valid according to bolton.
They're all like Camponotus mg02,  Camponotus undet, Aphaenogaster blf3, and such
We had a plan for another entry in the "global" section under browse called something like "All ants" or something... I can't remember the wording.  Luke would know
Anyway, your task, should you choose to accept it, is to add that "All ants" to the global section of browse.
It's mostly stubbed in throughout the code.

 me:  Hmm.  I don't quite follow.  It could wait for a better understanding?  There are a few stacktraces...
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key Eurasianants.locality
       at java.util.ResourceBundle.getObject(ResourceBundle.java:402)
       at java.util.ResourceBundle.getString(ResourceBundle.java:362)
       at org.calacademy.antweb.Map.setPoints(Map.java:222)
       at org.calacademy.antweb.Map.<init>(Map.java:55)
 Dave:  That's due to Brian not putting a locality in for the eurasian ants.
Did you deploy any new features or was it all infrastructure cleansing?

 me:  I'll send you the release notes.  Pretty much all infrasture cleansing.
 Dave:  That's great! You're making it a much better place.

 Dave:  So, this thing I was just talking about - search for "allants" in the code.  I think all you need to do is add a new project under the "global" biogeographic region named "all" and give it a title like "All Antweb" or whatever the hell the wording was, and it'll work.
Basically, the idea is that we want a project such that when someone clicks on the link to get all species, they get ALL species in antweb including Camponotus mg02.  Right now there's no way to do that.
 me:  Sounds good.  Is that through the master administrator?
 Dave:  Yep.  You can do it with Brian and Luke - that would be a nice togetherly thing to do.
Ooooo, and there's some art!
 Sent at 8:28 PM on Thursday
 Dave:  I'm not 100% sure I got all the code right.  It was the last thing I did and I did it poorly and in haste and didn't even finish it.
But, it's pretty close.  It'll just take some tweaking I'd bet.
 me:  You refer to the "All Ants" bit?
 Dave:  Yes... not the whole site!

The other thing I did in haste as I was leaving is for some reason there are two // after data/antweb.  It wasn't that way a month ago.  I think it's something in the ApplicationProperties file - like the document root or something.  It's annoying and I wish it were fixed.
I'm not sure how it got that way, or what the repercussions of fixing it will be.
You see what I mean, though, eh?

Any idea how to replicate the PropertyResourceBundle, key Eurasianants.locality
thing, or how to fix it?
You said Brian needs to add it - are we sure?

Hmm... looks like there's a problem with the UI on http://www.antweb.org/antweb_admin.jsp
There's no way to fix the locality problem...
for the eurasian ants

Hmm... actually, the locality is fine.
Hmm....

Oh.. ok the problem is for some reason whatever threw that stacktrace was looking for Eurasianants, not eurasianants
I know not why

Me:
  Brian wonders, "if I simply need to save the files as html and
then you can run the code."  I got the impression for our exchanges
that the process is a bit more extensive and worth going over.

Dave:
1. convert all to html
2.  there are 2 files that capture genus/subfamily info that need to
be combined (cat a b > c)
3.  then you copy the files over to a special directory
4.  then you can run the code
5.  you get an excel file that's just an authority file that brian can look at
6.  when he's happy with it, you upload the authority file to world ants

I'll need to poke around cvs to get the right directory for #3 and the
right path for #4

The annoying and most time consuming thing is the html conversion
