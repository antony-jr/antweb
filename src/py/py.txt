------------------------------------------------------------------

In effort to run src/py/imageCheck.py:
  python3 imageCheck.py

... I have it running but it is failing to connect to the database. Here is the process
of getting the code deployed on the server.

cp /Volumes/markDisk/dev/bak/requirements.txt src/py/
  # This was our old requirements.txt from the last server.

cd src/py/

virtualenv env -p python3

apt install python3-virtualenv
  
source env/bin/activate 
   
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Had to comment the #mysqlclient==1.3.10 our of requirements.txt
  But then the pip3 install fails.
  # online recommendation to switch to pymysql...

pip install pymysql

# Modified requirements.txt. Upgraded: six==1.14.0
# Recreated the virtualenv.

pip install flask_sqlalchemy
pip install flask_restful


python3 imageCheck.py

Error remaining is:
  sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on 'mysql' ([Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution)")
(Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/14/e3q8)

Seems that the packages are ironed out. I see from running pip freeze that there is whole lot more for a new requirements.txt.

Is it possible that the docker configuration requires a different means of database access?



--- More notes

cp /Volumes/markDisk/dev/bak/requirements.txt src/py/

cd src/py/

python3 imageCheck.py
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_sqlalchemy'

virtualenv env -p python3

source env/bin/activate 
   
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  # from: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

python3 imageCheck.py
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MySQLdb'

Had to comment the #mysqlclient==1.3.10 our of requirements.txt
  But then the pip3 install fails.

pip3 install pymysql
