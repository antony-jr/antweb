API v2.1 Deployment Documentation

Aside from this documentation, the v2.1 api was created by Jay Mollica <jaymollica@gmail.com>
It is not a part of the usual antweb deployment process. It is stored in a git repository.
Now the code is included in the Antweb distribution for backup purposes. 

Hoping to replace it with V3, which is in the Antweb distribution.

(This documentation by Mark).

antweb.php is an attempt to replace index.php. Don't believe it got anywhere.

(Aside from antweb.php) the other components need to be deployed to the apache directory:
/var/www/html/api/
